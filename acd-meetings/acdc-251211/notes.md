## Key understanding
From Tim Beiko:

- **focus on next fork feature selection**: I propose reconfiguring AllCoreDevs such that ACDE & ACDC focus on scoping the next hard fork, rather than implementing the current one. In addition to welcoming existing attendees, these calls could more explicitly solicit input from a broader range of community stakeholders.

- **focus on current fork**: To complement this, the existing testing/interop call would formally become “ACDT(esting)”, focused on the current fork’s implementation details, rather than setting its scope, ensuring that resolving technical issues doesn’t compete with high-level feature prioritization.
