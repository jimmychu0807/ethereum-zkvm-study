# Week 4 (Jul 7 - 12) Update

## Background

I am Jimmy Chu, and I am really keen to work on Ethereum protocol. I also have a special interested on programmable cryptography (more of my dev background can be seen in my [github profile](https://github.com/jimmychu0807)).

## What have I done in the past week

- Went through the [project-ideas page](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-six/blob/master/projects/project-ideas.md)

- Decided that the topics I would be most interested are:

  - [Grandine: zkVMs for Beacon Chain Snarkification](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-six/blob/master/projects/project-ideas.md#grandine-zkvms-for-beacon-chain-snarkification)

  - [Ream Client - A Beam client in Rust: Benchmark zkVM performance on Ream's Beacon state transition functions](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-six/blob/master/projects/project-ideas.md#ream-client---a-beam-client-in-rust-benchmark-zkvm-performance-on-reams-beacon-state-transition-functions)

## What am I going to do next

- Investigate about Grandine and Ream consensus clients
- Start with Grandine, talk to the dev team, and understand what need to be done specifically on Grandine task.
