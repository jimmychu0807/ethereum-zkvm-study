# Vault

- **ERC-4626**: it is a ERC20 and it generate yield/interest on itself, but limited to assets in the form of ERC-20. This require atomic deposits and redemptions.
- **ERC-7540**: allow asynchronous flow of ERC-4626 so the yield bearing instrument is extended to off-chain assets - t-bill, cross-chain asset, dividend-paying stocks.
- **ERC-7575**: allow multi-asset support, not just one kind of asset.
