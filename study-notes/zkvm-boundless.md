- Ethereum is migrating to be run in RISC-V so it can be prove with zkVM. During the transition, the contract code need to be able to compile to EOF (Ethereum Object format).

The zkVM
  - RISC Zero zkVM
  - Succinct SP1
  - Taiko implementation, supporting SGX
  - Brevis Network - Pico

# On zkVM

- Start from here: https://ethproofs.org/learn
  This shows different zkVM doing proofs for ethereum blocks
